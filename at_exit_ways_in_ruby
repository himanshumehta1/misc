- An exit code is a numeric value between 0 and 255. There’s a convention in the Unix world that an exit code equal to 0 means that the program was successful. Any other exit code denotes some kind of failure.
 
 By passing a block to Kernel.at_exit you can specify code that should be executed before the process exits, a good place to clean up anything that won’t be cleaned up as part of normal execution.

...
at_exit {
  # cleanup temp files
  # close open connections
}

data.each_line do |line|
  exit if line.match(pattern)
end

abort "No matches found"
